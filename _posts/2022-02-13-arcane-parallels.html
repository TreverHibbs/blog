  <p class="c0"><span>This post exists to get some of my thoughts on Arcane out of my head and into the world. After
      finishing Arcane I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about all the awesome parallels they managed to fit into it. At
      first I thought I would be able to hold the complete list of parallels in my head, but I eventually ran out of
      space. Never before have I seen a show contain so many interesting and powerful parallels that I couldn&rsquo;t
      contain them all in my head at one time. This intrigued me so much that I decided to document all of the parallels
      I could think of as well as some of the ones that were pointed out to me by others. <br><br>However, as I was
      compiling the list, though it was fun at the start, it became tedious. Therefore I have decided to simply post
      what I have and leave it at that.<br><br>I organized the list by character relationships and by character. If you
      are interested in deeper, more thural analysis that covers the significance of some of these parallelsI recommend
